## statments

a statement is  a line or unit of code that does one task or computation
each statement must be terminated by a semiocolon.

## Identifiers

used to name things such as classes variables and methods
Keywords cant be used 
may start with alphabet 
dollar may be used

## Variables

basic unit of storage in ajava porgram
a variable is a container that holds data
they must be named
### primitive datatypes

integer
byte
short 
long
flaot
boolean  : True or false
char

## Type Casting

Implicit Type Conversion: This occurs when the data type of a variable is automatically converted to another data type without the programmer's intervention. For example, if we try to assign an integer value to a double variable, the integer value is automatically converted to a double. This type of conversion is also known as widening or promotion.

Explicit Type Conversion: This occurs when the programmer manually converts the data type of a variable to another data type using type casting. Type casting involves specifying the desired data type in parentheses before the variable. For example, if we want to convert a double value to an integer, we would use the following code:
                      
Coercion is a term which is used to specify cases when the languafe automaticaly typecasts a variable to a type which maybe problematic.
