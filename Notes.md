## statments

a statement is  a line or unit of code that does one task or computation
each statement must be terminated by a semiocolon.

## Identifiers

used to name things such as classes variables and methods
Keywords cant be used 
may start with alphabet 
dollar may be used

## Variables

basic unit of storage in ajava porgram
a variable is a container that holds data
they must be named

### primitive datatypes

integer
byte
short 
long
flaot
boolean  : True or false
char

## Type Casting

Implicit Type Conversion: This occurs when the data type of a variable is automatically converted to another data type without the programmer's intervention. For example, if we try to assign an integer value to a double variable, the integer value is automatically converted to a double. This type of conversion is also known as widening or promotion.

Explicit Type Conversion: This occurs when the programmer manually converts the data type of a variable to another data type using type casting. Type casting involves specifying the desired data type in parentheses before the variable. For example, if we want to convert a double value to an integer, we would use the following code:
                      
Coercion is a term which is used to specify cases when the languafe automaticaly typecasts a variable to a type which maybe problematic. 

## Operators

## Java questions on strings

Sure, here are the answers to the 10 questions on Java Strings:

1. What is a Java string and how is it different from other data types?
Answer: A Java string is an object that represents a sequence of characters. Unlike other data types, strings are objects and not primitives. They are immutable, meaning that their values cannot be changed after creation.

2. How do you create a Java string and what are some common ways to initialize it?
Answer: You can create a Java string using the String class constructor or by using a string literal. Common ways to initialize a string include using double quotes ("") to enclose a sequence of characters or using the String.valueOf() method to convert another data type to a string.

3. What is the difference between a String object and a String literal in Java?
Answer: A String object is an instance of the String class, whereas a string literal is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes. String literals are automatically converted to String objects by the Java compiler.

4. Can you modify the contents of a Java string after it has been created?
Answer: No, Java strings are immutable, meaning that their values cannot be changed after creation. If you need to modify a string, you must create a new string object with the desired modifications.

5. How do you compare two Java strings for equality?
Answer: You can compare two Java strings for equality using the equals() method or the equalsIgnoreCase() method. The == operator can also be used, but it only checks if the two strings have the same memory address, not if they have the same value.

6. What is the role of the String Pool in Java and how does it impact string memory management?
Answer: The String Pool is a cache of string literals stored in memory. When you create a new string literal, Java checks the String Pool to see if an equivalent string already exists. If it does, the existing string is reused instead of creating a new one. This can save memory and improve performance.

7. How do you concatenate two or more Java strings together?
Answer: You can concatenate two or more Java strings together using the + operator or the concat() method. The StringBuilder class is also commonly used for more complex string concatenation operations.

8. What are some common methods provided by the Java String class for manipulating and working with strings?
Answer: Some common methods provided by the Java String class include length(), charAt(), indexOf(), substring(), toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(), trim(), and replace().

9. How do you convert a Java string to a different data type, such as an integer or a boolean?
Answer: You can convert a Java string to a different data type using methods provided by the wrapper classes for each data type, such as Integer.parseInt() for converting a string to an integer, or Boolean.parseBoolean() for converting a string to a boolean.

10. What are some best practices for working with Java strings, such as avoiding string concatenation in loops or using StringBuilder for large strings?
Answer: Some best practices for working with Java strings include using StringBuilder for large string concatenation operations, avoiding string concatenation in loops, and using the intern() method to add string literals to the String Pool when needed.

## Properties of abstract class

A class which contains the abstrat keyword in its declaration is known as a abstract class.

 Abstract classes can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
 
 Abstract classes may or may not contain abstract methods, but if a class has atleast one abstract method, then the class must mbe declared as abstract.
 
 When a class is declared as abstract it cannot be instatiated, to use an abstract class one must inherit from another class and provide implementation to the abstract methods in it.
